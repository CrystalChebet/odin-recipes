    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>Chapati is a beloved unleavened flatbread that holds a cherished place in the hearts and homes of many across East Africa, South Asia, and the Caribbean. Its simple yet versatile nature makes it a staple accompaniment to a wide array of dishes or a satisfying snack on its own. Made from a mixture of whole wheat flour, water, salt, and sometimes oil, chapati dough is kneaded to perfection until it reaches a smooth and elastic consistency. This dough is then divided into small balls, rolled out into thin circles, and cooked on a hot griddle or skillet until it puffs up and develops golden brown spots on both sides.</p>

    <p>Beyond its humble ingredients and straightforward preparation, chapati embodies a rich cultural heritage and a sense of communal warmth. It often takes center stage during festive celebrations, family gatherings, and everyday meals, symbolizing hospitality, togetherness, and the simple joys of sharing food with loved ones. Whether served alongside hearty curries, stews, or grilled meats, or enjoyed with a dollop of butter or a sprinkle of sugar, chapati transcends geographical boundaries to become a cherished culinary tradition that brings people together across cultures and generations.</p>
