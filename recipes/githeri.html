    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>Githeri is a traditional Kenyan dish that reflects the country's rich culinary heritage and diverse agricultural bounty. It's a hearty stew typically made with a combination of maize (corn) and beans, simmered together with various vegetables and spices. The maize and beans are often soaked overnight to soften them before cooking, enhancing their texture and flavor. Once cooked, githeri becomes a comforting and nutritious dish, packed with protein, fiber, and essential nutrients. The vegetables added to the stew can vary depending on seasonal availability and personal preference but commonly include ingredients like potatoes, carrots, peas, and tomatoes, infusing the dish with vibrant colors and fresh flavors.
    </p>
    <p>Beyond its nutritional value, githeri holds cultural significance in Kenya, often enjoyed as a communal meal shared among family and friends. It's a dish that brings people together around the dinner table, fostering a sense of unity and connection. Whether served as a standalone meal or accompanied by a side of chapati or ugali (a staple maize meal), githeri represents a celebration of Kenyan culinary tradition and the spirit of community that accompanies it.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 cups dry mixed beans (soaked overnight, then boiled until tender)</li>
        <li>2 cups fresh maize/corn kernels (boiled until tender)</li>
        <li>250gm steak, cubed (optional)</li>
        <li>1 stock cube (to be used if you are not using any meat)</li>
        <li>2 tbsp oil</li>
        <li>1 onion, chopped finely</li>
        <li>2 tomatoes, chopped</li>
        <li>2 potatoes, boiled, peeled, and cubed</li>
        <li>1-2 green chilis, chopped (optional)</li>
        <li>1 tbsp. tomato paste/puree</li>
        <li>1/4 tsp. garlic paste</li>
        <li>1/4 tsp. red chili powder</li>
        <li>1/4 tsp. turmeric powder</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp. cumin powder</li>
        <li>Salt to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Give the pre-soaked beans a rinse and put them into a pan or pressure cooker.</li>
        <li>Add the maize (if you are using from a can you will not need to boil the corn).</li>
        <li>Add enough water to cover everything and sprinkle some salt.</li>
        <li>Boil or pressure cook them until tender (takes about 12 minutes in a pressure cooker).</li>
        <li>Drain but reserve the water they were cooked in as it contains a lot of flavor/nutrients and you can use this in place of plain water when cooking the githeri later.</li>
        <li>Boil the cubed steak (if you are using it) in water with a quarter tsp each of salt, pepper, ginger, and garlic until the meat is tender.</li>
        <li>Drain but reserve the stock/soup.</li>
        <li>Now we can start preparing the githeri.</li>
        <li>Heat the oil in a pan, add the chopped onions and fry until translucent (but not brown).</li>
        <li>Add the garlic paste and tomato paste followed by the chopped tomatoes.</li>
        <li>Cook on low heat until the tomatoes are mushy, stirring regularly and breaking up the tomato pieces with your spoon as you stir.</li>
        <li>If the mixture begins to stick to the bottom of the pan, add some of the water leftover from cooking the beans, a little bit at a time.</li>
        <li>Then add the chopped chilies.</li>
        <li>Once the tomatoes are cooked, add the cubes of steak and mix them in, followed by all the powdered spices.</li>
        <li>Next, add the boiled cubed potatoes and the cooked beans.</li>
        <li>Give everything a mix, then add the stock/soup leftover from boiling the meat or if you are not using any meat, dissolve a stock cube in some water and add it in.</li>
        <li>The liquid should just about cover the beans.</li>
        <li>Sprinkle 2 tsp. salt.</li>
        <li>Allow the githeri to gently simmer on low heat, giving an occasional stir until the mixture thickens and the flavors are well combined.</li>
        <li>Taste and adjust salt and spice.</li>
